# 🌱 Smart Agriculture System – SIH 2025

A **Smart Agriculture Platform** built for **SIH 2025**, integrating **IoT-based hardware sensors** with an **ML-powered analysis engine** to help farmers make data-driven decisions.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project connects soil and environmental sensors to collect real-time agricultural data (e.g., soil moisture, humidity, temperature). The data is processed by a **Machine Learning model** that provides actionable insights such as:

- 💧 **Irrigation recommendation** (need of water or not)  
- 🌡️ **Monitoring soil temperature & humidity levels**  
- 📊 **Crop health predictions & environmental analysis**  

The insights are visualized on a **frontend dashboard**, giving farmers a user-friendly interface for monitoring and decision-making.

## 🔧 Key Features
- **IoT Hardware Integration** → Collects soil and environmental parameters in real-time.  
- **ML Model Analysis** → Predicts and recommends actions based on sensor data.  
- **Smart Irrigation Suggestions** → Ensures efficient water usage.  
- **Interactive Dashboard** → Displays live sensor readings & ML insights.  
- **Scalable Architecture** → Can be extended with more sensors & models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Soil moisture sensors, humidity & temperature sensors  
- **Backend**: FastAPI (for API & ML model integration)  
- **ML Model**: Trained on agricultural datasets for soil & crop conditions  
- **Frontend**: React dashboard for visualization  
- **Database**:  MongoDB for storing historical data  

---

## 🌍 Impact
This project aims to support **sustainable farming practices**, reduce **water wastage**, and empower farmers with **AI-driven insights** for smarter agriculture.

---

## 📌 Future Scope
